Terraria Container
==================

A hopefully reasonable Terraria server instance in a Docker Container

What is This
------------

It's an instance of the terraria standalone server in a Docker container for
linux.

But Why?
--------

Game servers are ephemeral enough to be well suited to the purpose.
Also I have a big swarm where I can just shuffle game servers around.

What was wrong with the existing ones?
--------------------------------------

Nothing really, it's just yet another container image made by some asshole
on the internet who thought he knew better.

Can I use this?
---------------

If you want, but I can't guarantee the absence of russian backdoors, as
with every Docker image.
